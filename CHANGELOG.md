# ims-bootstrap Changelog

## 1.3.1

## 1.3.3

## 1.3.5

* Handle fields without a `formfield` in `widgets.ModelWidgets`

## 1.3.6

* Pass kwargs from `bootstrap_form`, `bootstrap_field`, and `render_value` through to the template
* Added a `render_readonly` templatetag for form fields; checks for `render_readonly` method on widgets

## 1.3.7

## 1.3.8

* Django 1.11 compatibility

## 1.3.9

* Use `formats.date_format` in `stringify` to respect `USE_L10N`
* Escape HTML in `stringify` by default

## 1.3.10

* Bundled a copy of the latest jQuery for convenience

## 1.3.11

* Added a `django/forms/widgets/attrs.html` override to add `form-control` to Django widgets automatically

## 2.0.0

* Updated local copy of Bootstrap to v4.3.1
* Updated Datepicker for Bootstrap to v1.9.0 for Bootstrap 4 support
* Updated `bootstrap/field.html` to respect new Bootstrap 4 structure for checkboxes and radios
* Moved closing tag of `.controls.clearfix` div in `field.html` to include the errorlist so `.invalid-feedback` reacts and displays properly
* Added `widgets.CheckboxInput` which includes the proper Bootstrap 4 class
* Added `.invalid-feedback` Bootstrap 4 class to field errorlists
* Changed help-text span tags to small tags, to reflect Bootstrap 4 styles
* Updated references to Bootstrap's documentation
* Added `.page-item` and `.page-link` classes in `pager.html` where appropriate
* Restructured the `non_field_errors` alerts in `form.html` to be more Bootstrap 4 like, with a fade transition and using &times; instead of an icon font
* Gave select widgets the `custom-select` class so they style cleanly when invalid

## 2.2.0

* Updated local copy of Bootstrap to v4.4.1 while maintaining 508 compliant colors

## 4.0.0

* Updated local copy of Bootstrap v4.4.1 with contrast adjustments for default colors, navbars, breadcrumbs, and alerts

## 5.0.0

* Upgraded to Bootstrap 5.2.3. These changes are breaking insofar as there have been naming changes to HTML classes, attributes, etc. within files of this package
in order to make this package Bootstrap 5-compatible (see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/migration/), but django-bootstrap constructs themselves have not had naming changes
(e.g., `bootstrap.widgets.Select` still has the same name).

## 5.0.1

* Removed `bootstrap/static/selectize/js/es5-shim.js` and `bootstrap/static/selectize/js/es5-shim.min.js`; they were causing `collectstatic` to fail.

##5.0.3

* Added [bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).
* Added [bootstap dialogs](https://github.com/nakupanda/bootstrap3-dialog).
